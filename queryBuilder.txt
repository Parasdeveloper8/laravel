DATABASE:Query Builder
Query Builder helps us to creating and executing sql queries in convenient way using Database class.

---- Import
1. `use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;`

---- GET
2.`$res = DB::table('table_name')->get();`

---- Using where
3.`$res = DB::table('table_name')->where('field_name','value')->get();`

---- getting first result
4.`$res = DB::table('table_name')->first();` 
You have to convert result into array 

---- to insert
5.`$res = DB::table('table_name')->insert([
    "key"=>"value",
    "key"=>"value",
])`

You can do much more things like update,delete,etc.

Eloquent:Query Builder
When query builder is used with Eloquent model.

In Eloquent ORM we don't define table name because we have created a model of table name
But in db query builder we define table name.

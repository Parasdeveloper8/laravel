Migration ->
Migration is a type of version control system for database
in laravel which helps in defining schema using PHP without
writing raw sql queries.

command :=
--> php artisan migrate

set `SESSION_DRIVER = file` to start using manually created database.

command to create table :=
--> php artisan make:migration create_name_table

--> php artisan migrate:reset

Reset means deleting all migration
Rollback means removing specific file in migration

--> php artisan migrate:rollback

we can rollback last two migration using --step flag
--> php artisan migrate:rollback --step 2

you can refresh migration using
--> php artisan migrate:refresh

we can migrate only single file using --path flag
